Dear $[FNAME|purchasing managers and valued
customers|purchasing managers and valued customers]$,

We have a number of important changes to announce, effective
immediately.

UPDATED PRICING

We have not had any significant price changes for more than
five years, but due to increased raw materials and
supply-chain costs, we have had to increase our prices
slightly:
 * Orders of 1–19 bags, $59 each
 * Orders of 20–49 bags, $56 each
 * Orders of 50 or more bags, $53 each
These new prices are effective immediately — however,
companies with existing contracts will not be affected until
the end of the contract period.


NEW DISTRIBUTION CONTACTS

In a greater effort to manage our costs and supply chains,
distribution of Multi-Etch is coming in-house and will be
headed up by our new Sales Manager, Antonio Giordano
Antonio@MultiEtch.com [Antonio@MultiEtch.com] and crew.

There will be a transition period, June 21–July 20, during
which time you can order Multi-Etch directly online
[https://www.multietch.com/], by calling us at 800–297–6707
[tel:8002976707], or by calling Reactive Metals Studio at
800–876–3434 [tel:8008763434] until July 20, 2022.

As always, if you have any technical questions or need
assistance with optimizing your etching process, please call
us [tel:8002976707] or email us at info@MultiEtch.com
[info@MultiEtch.com].

We want to emphasize that we are not changing anything about
production, so rest assured that you will receive exactly
the same quality product you are used to receiving.

We thank you for your continued patronage and invite you to
call or email with any concerns about the changes described
above.

Happy etching!
