        >We want you to be successful with Multi-Etch in whatever ways you are
        using it, so we've tested it extensively on a variety of metals, both
        reactive and nonreactive, for purposes including anodizing, cleaning,
        welding prep and more. We've tested heated as well as room temperature
        Multi-Etch.</p

        >We did find that room-temperature, double strength Multi-Etch, after
        having been activated by heating it one time, etches more quickly. When
        prepping for anodization or welding, we recommend starting at two
        minutes instead of ten.</p

        of the results of testing grade 4 titanium strips for anodizing and
        welding prep in room-temperature Multi-Etch. We etched for varying
        amounts of time, from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. You'll notice that the
        high voltage pinks look great!</p
