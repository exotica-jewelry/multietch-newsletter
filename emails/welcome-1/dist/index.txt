When you purchase Multi-Etch, it’s good for at least a year.
We’ve determined Multi-Etch in solution gets a little
stronger, and works a little faster, the older it is. We’ve
tested Multi-Etch in solution up to 15 months and it works
great. Unmixed powder is good for at least 11 years.

Heated Multi-Etch works fastest, but room-temperature
Multi-Etch can work too! We’ve written a step-by-step guide
to using Multi-Etch at room temperature to help you along.

The equal-opportunity etchant: We developed Multi-Etch
especially for titanium, but it works on a list of 23 types
of metals, and growing!
